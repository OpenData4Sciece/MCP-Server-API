# MCP Server ‚Äì Machine-Consumable Protocol Compliant API for ML Services

MCP Server is a structured, standards-compliant API for serving metadata, service discovery endpoints, and machine learning content. It's designed to help AI and data science applications discover model context, training artefacts, research notebooks, and statistical methods efficiently.

This server is based on the [MCP specification](https://www.modelcontext.org/spec) and is production-ready with clean TypeScript code and modular design.


## Features üöÄ

- `.well-known/model-context` for model-level context resolution
- Service discovery endpoint at `/v1/discovery`
- `/v1/content` endpoint to list data science and ML resources
- Clean Fastify setup, with plugin structure and async loading
- Environment variable support via `.env`


## Get Started

1. `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
2. `npm run dev` to launch the server with auto-reload (via `nodemon`).
3. Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and configure the variables for your environment.


### Other Commands

- `npm run start` - start the server in standard mode (without auto-reload).
- `npm run prod` - optimised production run. This compiles the TS files then runs the server.
- `npm run build` - compile the TypeScript source code into JavaScript.


### Utility

- `npm run prettier:check` ‚Äì check formatting issues using Prettier.
- `npm run prettier:fix` ‚Äì fix formatting issues automatically.

## What is an MCP Server?

A **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** is not just a typical REST API. Instead of primarily exchanging data or performing CRUD operations, an MCP server serves **machine-readable metadata and context descriptions** about your machine learning services or AI models.

Its main goal is to provide **structured discovery endpoints**‚Äîusually under the `.well-known` path‚Äîthat allow AI agents, language models, and tooling to **understand what services you offer, how to interact with them, and their semantic context** without human interpretation.


## How is MCP different from a normal API?

- **Purpose:** Traditional APIs serve application data and actions; MCP servers serve metadata about your models/services.
- **Endpoints:** MCP heavily uses `.well-known/model-context` for discovery, making it easily discoverable and standardised.
- **Format:** MCP responses use semantic formats like JSON-LD to encode context and relationships, rather than just raw JSON data.
- **Consumers:** Instead of front-end apps or users, MCP endpoints target **AI agents, federated services, or tooling ecosystems**.
