📊 Just launched a public MCP server for my freelance data science work using Fastify + TypeScript.

Now AI agents and clients can auto-discover my services. Here's why it matters 🧵

1. Instead of static CVs, I expose structured JSON about my services & expertise:
   → /v1/content
   → /.well-known/model-context

2. This lets tools like GPT, Claude, and LangChain **find** me when people search for skills I offer.

3. I included:
   - ML model summaries
   - Dataset links
   - Notebooks
   - Statistical services

4. Tech stack:
   - Fastify ⚡️
   - TypeScript 🟦
   - JSON over HTTP 💬

5. Want your own?
   DM me or check this open-source repo (or ask ChatGPT how to make an MCP server 😉)
